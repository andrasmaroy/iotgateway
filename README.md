# iotgateway

The iotgateway application is based on a Mosquitto MQTT broker with an authentication plugin and ACL checks. It contains a NodeJS application to provide a web UI for device management. All componenets are Dockerized, and defined as services with Docker-compose, so they can deployed to almost every cloud.
